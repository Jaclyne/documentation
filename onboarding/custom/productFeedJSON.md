# Findify JSON Feed format

## Introduction
This document presents the product feed specification for the __JSON__ feeds to be sent to Findify.

In order for the product feed to be synchronized periodically with the search engine, the JSON file must be accessible via HTTP or HTTPS. Findify is supporting files behind basic authentication.

## Custom fields

Custom fields can be added in the feed, in addition of the fields described above. Custom fields can contain a large panel of information, specific to your products or to your business. Defining a custom field make it automatically searchable for the Findify search: customers will be able to make queries to match their inner content. Custom fields can also be configured as filters in the Findify Dashboard.

At the moment, only the custom fields that have a type **String** or **Double** are accepted. 

To include custom fields, add a new field whose name is your custom field name.
Here is an example where the custom fields gender and occasion have been added to the product mandatory and optional fields.
```json
{
  "id": "tddy123uk",
  "sku": "OY1236H3",
  "title": "Men's long sleeves white shirt",
  "description": "This product has long sleeve, comfortable fabric, button front closure and a solid color",
  "price": 69,
  "image_url": "http://www.example.com/my_image.jpg",
  "product_url": "http://www.example.com/my_product",
  "category": "Clothing > Shirt > For work",
  "thumbnail_url": "http://www.example.com/my_image_small.jpg",
  "availability": "in stock",
  "created_at": "2014-04-22T06:00:00Z",
  "brand": "Calvin Klein",
  "material": "60% Cotton, 40% Polyester",
  "color": "white",
  "size": "L",
  "quantity": 30,
  "gender": "Man",
  "occasion": "wedding"
}
```

## Variants

If your feed contain variants, by default, Findify will group them into one unique product. By specifying the field “item_group_id” and filling it with a common value for the variants you want to group, we will group these variants into 1 product.

```json
{
  "id": "610010",
  "title": "Men's long sleeves white shirt",
  "price": 54,
  "size": "L",
  ...
  "item_group_id": "630446"
}
{
  "id": "610011",
  "title": "Men's long sleeves white shirt",
  "price": 60,
  "size": "XL",
  ...,
  "item_group_id": "630446"
}
```

Here the same T-shirt available in both sizes L and XL will be grouped into 1 unique product.

If your model does not permit it, grouping the variants according to the product URL or another field from the set of mandatory fields is also possible. Let us know if it is the case!

## Structure of the product feed

We are accepting different structures for the JSON feed. You can choose the one you prefer depending on the complexity on your side to generate the feed.

### 1 product per line (JSONL format)
```json
{"id": "15363", "title": "Long sleeve shirt", ... }
{"id": "73829", "title": "Short sleeve shirt", ... }
```

### 1 array containing all the products
```json
[{"id": "15363", "title": "Long sleeve shirt", ... },
{"id": "73829", "title": "Short sleeve shirt", ... }]
```

### All the products into a "products" object
```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "title": "Long sleeve shirt",
      "id": "15363",
      ...
    },
    {
      "title": "Short sleeve shirt",
      "id": "73829",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

## Remove some products from appearing in the search

Sometimes, you would like to remove some products from the search. This can be useful when the feed is automatically generated or if you have wholesale products you do not wish to make them appear in the search results. In order to remove these products, you need to add another field named “tags” and give it the value **findify-remove**. 

```json
{
  "id": "637382",
  "title": "Long sleeve shirt for kid",
  ...
  "tags": "findify-remove"
}
```

In case you have already tags in your feed, separate the value “findify-remove" from the other values with a comma: “findify-remove, tag1, tag2”.
