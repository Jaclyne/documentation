# Findify XML Feed Format

## Introduction

This document presents the product feed specification for the __XML__ feeds to be sent to Findify.

In order for Findify to synchronize periodically your products with our system, the XML file must be publicly accessible. Findify is supporting feeds available via HTTP or HTTPS (behind a basic authentication).

## Custom fields

Custom fields that are not part of the model above but can be specified in the feed. Custom fields can contain a large panel of information, specific to your products or to your business. Defining a custom field make it automatically searchable: customers will be able to make queries to match their inner content. Custom fields can also be configured as filters in the Findify Merchant Dashboard.

__At the moment, only custom fields that have a type of **String** or **Double** are accepted.__

To include new custom fields, add a new element which name is the custom field name in the product element.

## Variants

Your feed can contain variants. Specifying the optional field __*item_group_id*__ and filling it with a common value for the variants you want to group will let us group these variants into 1 product.

If your model does not permit it, grouping the variants according to the product URL or another field from the set of mandatory fields is also possible. Let us know at yourfriends@findify.io if you want to make this happen.

## Product feed example in XML

The following example contains all the mandatory fields, some of the optional fields and the custom_field "*gender*".

## Remove some products from appearing in the search

It is possible to remove some products from the search. This can be useful when the feed is automatically generated. In order to remove some products, you need to add another field named __“tags”__ and give it the value **findify-remove**. 

In case you have already tags in your feed, separate the value __findify-remove__ from the other values with a comma: _“findify-remove, tag1, tag2”_.
